                                    event sequences; called by TSparse
 	
  Creating statistics
    TSparse                     - Computes user-specified statistics from
                                    event sequences found by TSmatch; ; often 
                                    called from TStrialstat & TSsessionstat
    TSsessionstat               - Computes user-specified statistics taking   
                                    TSData as input and putting results into
                                    user-specified field
    TStrialstat                 - Creates trial statistics by finding user-
                                    specified sequences within trials and
                                    computing stats from those sequences
                                    using user-specified function; puts results
